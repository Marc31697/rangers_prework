		Hello. My name is Marquese Brown. I was born and raised in Brick, New Jersey and have spent
		my entire life in Jersey. I went to college at Stockton University and received a Bachelors degree
		in Criminal Justice in 2019. I served as a police officer in Ocean City, NJ and decided to change my career.
		I worked as an IT support technician doing tier 1 helpdesk for an MSP for 7 months and have since
		left that position to pursue programming
	</p>
    <h3 style="background-color:LightGray;">
	Why Web Development?
    </h3>
	<p id="p1">
		I am looking to pursue any form of programming as a career. It was one of my passions when I
		discoverd it in High School and I never considered it as a full time career (Silly me). I have always
		enjoyed programming and it has never seemed to stress me out.
